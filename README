Assignment 2

This is a basic tool to visualize Kiva loan success rates across many variables.
As of 11/2/2011 it's incomplete/buggy. 

Instructions:
Export or clone the source to a directory. From that directory, run:
$ python SimpleHTTPServer 8888

Then navigate to http://localhost:8888 to test. This is necessary because 
the tool uses JSON callbacks.
